# Movie Watchlist
## Introduction
It's a website that lets you search for movies and add them to a custom watchlist. You can change between the search page and the watchlist page, and remove movies from the watchlist too.
This Solo Project was made to practice the interaction with APIs, in this case with the "OMDb" API.
